# EyeHealth
This project is for people's eye health. This program pops up a notification every 20 Minutes to remind you to close the eyese for 30 seconds. After those 30 seconds, it pops up another notification that you can now open your eyes. The whole program keeps in the background without a visible window.
# How to use it on every startup
Right click onto ShellStartupScript.bat, 
click on 'edit', 
replace the path with the path of the .exe file (...\EyeHealth\EyeHealth\bin\Debug\EyeHealth.exe), 
save it, copy the file, 
press WIN + R, type in 'shell:startup', press ok, 
paste the file here

At the moment, the program needs to be shut down manually via the Task manager.
If you don't want to start it everytime the computer is booted, press WIN + R, type in 'shell:startup', press ok, delete ShellStartupScript.bat

Thanks for the interest :)
